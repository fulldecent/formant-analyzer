# Vowel Practice: therapeutic guide

## Introduction to vowel-based speech therapy

Vowel Practice helps you improve vowel pronunciation for  speech therapy, accent training, and English as a Second Language (ESL)  learning. The app visualizes formant frequencies/resonances of your  vocal tract that define vowel sounds—allowing you to see and refine your articulation in real time.

## Why monophthongs? The therapeutic foundation

Vowel Practice focuses exclusively on **monophthongs** (pure vowel sounds) rather than diphthongs (vowel glides). This choice  is based on established speech therapy and phonetics research:

### Stable articulatory targets

Monophthongs provide fixed tongue and jaw positions that you  can hold and feel. When practicing /i/ (as in "see"), your tongue  maintains a high, front position throughout. This stability allows you  to:

- Develop proprioceptive awareness (knowing where your tongue is)
- Practice and perfect each position individually
- Build muscle memory for consistent production

### Building blocks for complex sounds

Diphthongs are simply movements between two monophthong positions. For example:

- /aɪ/ (as in "my") = /a/ → /i/ (glide from low to high front)
- /oʊ/ (as in "go") = /o/ → /u/ (glide from mid to high back)

By mastering individual monophthong targets first, you naturally gain the ability to produce smooth transitions between them.

### Simplified motor planning

For individuals with speech impairments or those learning  English, monophthongs reduce cognitive and motor complexity. Holding a  single position is easier than coordinating movement, making  monophthongs ideal for:

- Speech therapy for dysarthria or apraxia
- ESL learners whose native language has different vowel systems
- Accent modification focusing on vowel clarity

### Clear visual feedback

The formant plot shows stable, distinct regions for each  monophthong. When you produce a pure vowel correctly, your formant  marker (oval) stays consistently in the target region, providing  immediate visual confirmation.

## The ten American English monophthongs

Vowel Practice uses the standard set of American English  monophthongs, based on the Hillenbrand et al. (1995) acoustic database.  Each vowel is labeled with:

- **IPA symbol**: international phonetic alphabet notation (e.g., /i/, /æ/, /ɑ/)
- **Wells keyword**: a standard reference word in small caps (e.g., fleece, trap, lot)
- **Common words**: example words to help you identify the sound

### High vowels

- **/i/ - fleece**: see, beat, me (high front tense)
- **/ɪ/ - kit**: sit, bit, if (high front lax)
- **/u/ - goose**: too, boot, food (high back rounded)
- **/ʊ/ - foot**: book, put, good (high back lax)

### Mid vowels

- **/ɛ/ - dress**: bed, get, tell (mid front)
- **/ə/ - comma**: about, sofa, taken (mid central schwa)
- **/ʌ/ - strut**: but, cup, son (mid back)

### Low vowels

- **/æ/ - trap**: cat, bad, man (low front)
- **/ɑ/ - lot**: cot, on, pot (low back unrounded)
- **/ɔ/ - thought**: caught, law, fall (low back rounded)

**Note on excluded vowels**: Pure /e/ and /o/  sounds do not exist as monophthongs in standard American English—they  are pronounced as diphthongs [eɪ] and [oʊ]. These are reserved for  advanced diphthong practice or for ESL learners whose native language  (Spanish, Italian, Japanese) includes these pure vowels.

## Using the Vowel Practice app

### Toolbar controls

- **Recording indicator**: a green square appears when the microphone is active, showing that the app is capturing your speech in real time.

- Audio source button

  : tap to select your audio source:                

  - **Microphone**: live recording for practice
  - **Pre-recorded files**: example vowel sounds (e.g., "arm", "beat") for reference

- Mode picker

  : switch between modes using the segmented control:                

  - **Formant mode** (waveform icon): displays the vowel chart with your formants
  - **Help mode** (question mark icon): shows this guide
  - **Chart mode** (chart icon): reserved for future features

### Understanding the formant plot

The formant plot is a vowel chart showing the acoustic space of American English vowels:

- **Horizontal axis (formant 2)**: front (left) to back (right) tongue position
- **Vertical axis (formant 1)**: close/high (top) to open/low (bottom) jaw position
- **Mel scale**: the chart uses a perceptually-motivated frequency scale, making vowel spacing more natural to the human ear
- **Voronoi diagram**: colored regions show the closest vowel to each point, helping you visualize vowel boundaries

### Interpreting your formants

When you speak, the app displays your vowel as oval markers on the chart:

- **Black oval**: shows your F1 (first formant) and F2 (second formant) position

- **Gray oval**: shows your F1 and F3 (third formant) position, if available

- Oval size

  : reflects the "sharpness" (Q factor) of each resonance:                

  - Smaller ovals = sharper, more focused resonances
  - Larger ovals = broader resonances or less stable production

### Target vowel labels

IPA symbols (e.g., /i/, /æ/, /u/) appear on the chart at  their ideal formant positions for adult male speakers in General  American English. Your goal is to position your oval marker near the  target vowel's symbol.

## Practicing vowel sounds

### Recommended practice sequence

**Level 1: corner vowels** (easiest)

- /i/ (fleece), /u/ (goose), /ɑ/ (lot)
- These extreme positions are easiest to feel and produce consistently
- They form the "vowel triangle" that defines the acoustic space

**Level 2: mid vowels**

- /ɛ/ (dress), /ɔ/ (thought), /ə/ (comma)
- Intermediate positions between the corners

**Level 3: near contrasts** (most challenging)

- /i/ vs /ɪ/ (fleece vs kit): distinguish "beat" from "bit"
- /ɛ/ vs /æ/ (dress vs trap): distinguish "bet" from "bat"
- /ɑ/ vs /ɔ/ (lot vs thought): distinguish "cot" from "caught" (if your dialect maintains this contrast)

### Practice technique

1. **Choose a target vowel**: select one of the ten monophthongs to practice

2. **Say example words**: speak words containing that vowel (e.g., "see, beat, me" for /i/)

3. **Isolate the vowel**: hold the vowel sound alone (e.g., "eeeeee" for /i/)

4. **Check the plot**: observe where your oval appears relative to the target symbol

5. Adjust your articulation

   :                

   - If too high: open your jaw more
   - If too low: close your jaw slightly
   - If too far front: pull your tongue back
   - If too far back: push your tongue forward

6. **Repeat**: practice until your marker consistently lands in the target region

### Tips for effective practice

- **Speak at normal volume**: too quiet or too loud can affect formant detection
- **Hold vowels steady**: maintain a stable position for 1-2 seconds
- **Practice daily**: 5-10 minutes per day builds muscle memory
- **Use pre-recorded files**: listen to and study reference pronunciations
- **Focus on feel**: pay attention to where your tongue and jaw are positioned
- **Start simple**: master corner vowels before moving to near contrasts

## Applications

### Speech therapy

For individuals with dysarthria, apraxia, or articulation disorders, Vowel Practice provides:

- Visual biofeedback for vowel production
- Clear targets for motor planning
- Objective measurement of progress

### Accent modification

For accent training or neutralization, the app helps you:

- Identify vowel substitutions from your native language
- Shift vowel positions toward General American targets
- Develop consistent, native-like vowel production

### ESL learning

For English language learners, especially from languages with different vowel systems (Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, etc.), the app  provides:

- Visual representation of English vowel contrasts not present in your native language
- Practice distinguishing minimal pairs (e.g., "ship" vs "sheep")
- Foundation for learning English diphthongs later

## Getting started

1. Open Vowel Practice and select "Microphone" as the audio source
2. Choose formant mode (waveform icon) to see the vowel chart
3. Start with a corner vowel: say "eee" for /i/ (fleece) and hold it
4. Observe where your black oval appears on the chart
5. Adjust your tongue position to move the oval closer to the /i/ symbol
6. Try other vowels, using the practice sequence above
7. Return to this help guide anytime using the question mark icon

## Technical notes

Vowel Practice uses formant frequency analysis based on established acoustic phonetics research:

- **Base formant values**: Hillenbrand, Getty, Clark, & Wheeler (1995)
- **Wells lexical sets**: Wells (1982), *Accents of English*
- **Mel-scale transformation**: Stevens, Volkmann, & Newman (1937)
- **Therapeutic approach**: Kent & Read (2002), *Acoustic Analysis of Speech*

Happy practicing!
